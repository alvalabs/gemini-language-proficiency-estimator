   - Vocabulary usage and range
   - Fluency and coherence
   - Overall communication effectiveness

3. Output a lower and upper bound for the speaker's proficiency level (CEFR) based on the analysis.

4. Determine if the speaker's response actually answers the question that was asked

5. Provide your assessment in the following format:
   
   **Lower bound for proficiency level (CEFR):**[A1(beginner)/A2(elementary)/B1(intermediate)/B2(upper intermediate)/C1(advanced)/C2(mastery)]

   **Upper bound for proficiency level (CEFR):**[A1(beginner)/A2(elementary)/B1(intermediate)/B2(upper intermediate)/C1(advanced)/C2(mastery)]
